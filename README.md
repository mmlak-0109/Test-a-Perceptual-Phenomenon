## Welcome to my "Test a Perceptual Phenomenon" Project Page!

I completed this project for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree "Statistics" course.

In this course, I learned how to do the following things:

- Identify components of an experiment
- Use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
- Set up a hypothesis test, and use inferential statistis to make inferences from a sample and draw conclusions based on the results

For this project, I ultilized Google Sheets to analyze the Stroop Effect using descriptive statistics to provide an intuition about the data, and inferential statistics to draw a conclusion based on the results. I found that the Incongruent words sample mean was larger than the Congruent words sample mean at 22.02 and 14.05 seconds respectively, and that this difference was extremely statistically significant with a P-value of 0.00005.

PDF files of my original data sheet and written report, and copies of my orignal data sheet in .xlsx and .ods files, can be found by clicking the "View on GitHub" link above.

Enjoy!
