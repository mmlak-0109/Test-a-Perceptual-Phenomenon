## Welcome to my "Test a Perceptual Phenomenon" Project Page!

I completed this project for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree "Statistics" course.

In this course, I learned how to do the following things:

- Identify components of an experiment
- Use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
- Set up a hypothesis test, and use inferential statistics to make inferences from a sample and draw conclusions based on the results

For this project, I utilized Google Sheets to analyze the Stroop Effect using descriptive statistics to provide an intuition about the data, and inferential statistics to draw a conclusion based on the results. I found that the Incongruent words sample mean was larger than the Congruent words sample mean at 22.02 and 14.05 seconds respectively, and that this difference was extremely statistically significant with a P-value of 0.00005.
